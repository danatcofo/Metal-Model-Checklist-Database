Its offensize power was above and beyond that of the Zeon Zakus™.",

        "description": "The Gundam Barbatos™ is one of 72 \"Gundam\" frames that was produced and used in the Calamity War. After it was recovered, Chryse Guard Security used it as a power reactor; aside from the fact that its Ahab Reactors were still functional, this was done mainly because Barbatos' cockpit was missing when it was found. A new cockpit similar to the one used by the CGS mobile workers was installed prior to its redeployment by the 3rd Group. Poor maintenance over the centuries since the Calamity War has degraded the Barbatos' armor and full combat potential. This is later rectified by Teiwaz technicians, who not only restored the Barbatos to its original look but also returned it back to a performance close to its original.",

Its superior capabilities were in part due to its amazingly light weight that made it one of the fastest, most maneuverable and one of the longest-ranged single-engine fighter aircraft of World War II. However, that tradeoff in weight was at the price of not having self-sealing fuel tanks which made it prone to catching fire and exploding when struck by enemy fire, and no armor protection for either the pilot or the engine.",

The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge constructed from concrete and steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old medieval structure. This was preceded by a succession of timber bridges; the first was built by the Roman founders of London.",

It has three wings: a stationary center foil and two articulated flanking wings. When in flight, the side wings fold out for greater stabilization. When landing, the wings fold in, shrinking the vessel's silhouette. The well-armed vessel has two forward-facing double laser cannons, two wing-mounted double cannons, and a rear-facing double laser cannon. It is equipped with a hyper drive.",
