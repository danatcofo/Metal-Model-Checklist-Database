    "description": "Vintage Deep Sea Diving Suit was a type of watertight garment used for deep underwater commercial work, including marine salvage and pearl shell diving. The suit protected divers from the pressure of the ocean and allowed them to breath underwater. It consisted of a diving helmet, a waterproofed canvas suit, an air hose, a diving knife and weights to counteract buoyancy.",
