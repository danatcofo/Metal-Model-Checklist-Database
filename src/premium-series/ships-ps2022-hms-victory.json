    "description": "HMS Victory is a 104-gun first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. Launched in 1765, she is the world’s oldest naval vessel still in commission. Victory is best known for her role as Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. That battle cemented Britain’s dominance as a sea power through the early 20th century.",
