    "description": "Concorde SST is the world’s only supersonic transport. It achieved Mach 2 speed (1,354 mph), setting a record during flight from London to New York in just over 3 hours. The Concorde was conceived during a time when the world rose to accept bold challenges such as the pledge “to land a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” Both the Concorde’s maiden flight and the first moon landing occurred in 1969.",
