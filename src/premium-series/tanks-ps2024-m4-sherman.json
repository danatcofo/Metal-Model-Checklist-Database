    "description": "The M4 Sherman was the primary tank used by the United States during World War II. The tank was named after Union General William Tecumseh Sherman. Production exceeded 50,000 units. Only the Soviet T-34 tank was produced in larger numbers during World War II. Though it was wholly inadequate against the heavier armed 56 ton German Tiger I and the 72 ton Tiger II, mobility, mechanical reliability and sheer numbers helped offset their disadvantages strategically.",
