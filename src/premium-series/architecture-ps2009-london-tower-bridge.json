    "description": "The London Tower Bridge, built in 1886-1894 over the River Thames, is both a suspension and a drawbridge. It has become an iconic symbol of London and was featured in many films such as the 2009 Sherlock Holmes movie. This 244 meter bridge consists of two towers (65 meters high) tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways.",
