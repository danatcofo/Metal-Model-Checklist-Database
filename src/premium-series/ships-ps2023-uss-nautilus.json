    "description": "USS Nautilus (SSN-571) was the world's first nuclear-powered submarine and the sixth ship of the fleet to bear the name NAUTILUS. On January 17, 1955, the order was given to cast off all lines and signaled the historic message, “Underway On Nuclear Power.” Over the next several years, NAUTILUS shattered all submerged speed and distance records plus becoming the first submarine to complete a submerged transit of the North Pole.",
