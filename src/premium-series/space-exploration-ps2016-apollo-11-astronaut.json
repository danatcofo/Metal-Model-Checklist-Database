    "description": "On July 20, 1969, Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the Moon. Their NASA space suits allowed these astronauts to explore the lunar surface for over two hours in temperatures ranging from -183 to 106 degrees Celsius. Armstrong and Aldrin then boarded the lunar module, rejoined fellow astronaut Michael Collins aboard their command module, and returned safely to Earth.",
