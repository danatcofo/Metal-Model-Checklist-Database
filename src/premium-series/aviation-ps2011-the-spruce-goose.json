    "description": "The Hughes H-4 Hercules nicknamed the Spruce Goose by critics, was designed as a transatlantic transport plane for use during World War II though it was not completed until after the war. Due to restrictions during the war on the use of aluminum and also concerns about weight, the plane was built almost entirely of birch wood. It was the largest amphibious plane to ever fly though that was only one brief flight on November 2, 1947. The aircraft remains in good condition and is currently on display at the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, USA.",
