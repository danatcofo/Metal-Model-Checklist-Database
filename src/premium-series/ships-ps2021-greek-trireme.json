    "description": "The Trireme is an ancient Greek warship featuring three banks of oars from which it gets its name. A formidable military vessel, it was feared for its speed, maneuverability, and its powerful bronze battering ram used to sink enemy ships. The Trireme permitted Athens to build its maritime empire and dominate the Aegean in the 5th century BCE.",
