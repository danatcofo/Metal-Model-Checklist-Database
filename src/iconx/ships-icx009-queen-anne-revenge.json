    "description": "Queen Anne's Revenge was the name of the flagship of the English pirate known as Blackbeard. He used her for less than a year, but was an effective tool in his prize-taking. In 1718, Blackbeard ran the ship aground at Beaufort Inlet, Carteret County, North Carolina, in the present-day United States. In late 1996, Intersal, a private contractor working for the state of North Carolina in marine recovery, discovered the remains of a vessel likely to be Queen Anne's Revenge.",
