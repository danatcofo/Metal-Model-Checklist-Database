    "description": "The successor to the first fielded mobile suit, the Zaku II™ improved on everything the previous model offered. It was faster, far more durable, had a better Minovsky Reactor, and could be fitted with far more weapons. The Zaku II™ was the mainstay of the Zeon military for most of the One Year War.",
