    "description": "This massive stone amphitheater was commissioned around A.D. 70 by Emperor Vespasian as a gift to the Roman people. In A.D. 80, his son Titus opened the Colosseum with 100 days of games, including gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights. The colosseum remained in use for more than four centuries.",
