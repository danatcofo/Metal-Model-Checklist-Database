    "description": "Z'Gok™ is a mass production amphibious mobile suit. Z'Gok™ was very agile and fast in and out of water. MIP also replaced the bulky ballast water tanks used by the Gogg and Acguy for cooling off the mobile suit for out of water operations with an air cooling fan system. Notably, the weapon layouts were improved.",
