    "description": "The technical name for this four-wheel drive military vehicle produced by AM General is the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle™ (HMMWV). It was designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport behind front lines and not as a front line fighting vehicle. The Humvee has become the vehicular backbone of U.S. forces around the world and its widespread use in the Persian Gulf War helped inspire the Hummer line of civilian automobiles",
