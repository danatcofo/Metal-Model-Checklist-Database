    "description": "Gundam™ is the titular mobile suit of Mobile Suit Gundam™. The Gundam™ was incredibly advanced for its time. Built from lightweight Luna Titanium Alloy, its frame was both lighter than that of Zeon's mass-produced mobile suits and much sturdier, able to shrug off a Zaku II's machine gun fire with little to no damage. Its offensize power was above and beyond that of the Zeon Zakus™.",
