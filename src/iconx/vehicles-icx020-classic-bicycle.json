    "description": "First seen in the 1880s, it was labeled the safety bicycle. It featured equally sized wheels, a chain drive to the rear wheel, pneumatic tires, and a front wheel with significant castor. Susan B. Anthony, the American feminist, called it the first bicycle that was suitable for women and labeled it the “freedom machine.”",
