    "description": "The Imperial AT-AT™ is a heavily armored quadrupedal walker deployed by the Galactic Empire™ for ground assault and troop deployment. Standing over 20 meters tall, its reinforced hull withstands most infantry weapons, while its chin-mounted heavy blasters and head-mounted laser cannons suppress enemy forces. Troop compartments allow it to deliver squads of stormtroopers directly into combat zones.",
