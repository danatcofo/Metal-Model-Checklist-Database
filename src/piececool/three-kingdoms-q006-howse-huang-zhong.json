    "description": "Huang Zhong, surnamed Han Sheng, is one of the five tiger generals. He is good at archery, with a hundred shots and a hundred hits. He has a knife in close combat and a bow in a long-range battle, and his strength is extraordinary. He became a great tool late, was discovered by Liu Bei's wise eyes, and made great achievements in battle, so he became a synonym for the old man.",
