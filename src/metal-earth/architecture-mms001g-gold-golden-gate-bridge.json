    "description": "The Golden Gate is an art deco suspension bridge that stretches across San Francisco Bay and is one of the most enduring symbols of the city. Its construction arose from the need to get from San Francisco to Marin County, California and the ferry traffic in San Francisco Bay had become just too heavy. Construction on the Golden Gate Bridge began in 1933, and was completed in 1937.",
