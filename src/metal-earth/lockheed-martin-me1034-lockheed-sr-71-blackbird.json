At full velocity the airplane surface heats up to over 260°C+ (500 °F). A total of 3,551 missions were flown and not one Blackbird was lost due to enemy military retaliation.Note: Skunk Works is the nickname for Lockheed's Advanced Development Programs. Skunk Works engineers have developed highly advanced, military aircraft, often in secret, since World War II.",
