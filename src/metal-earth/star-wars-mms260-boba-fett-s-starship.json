    "description": "The deadly ship was infamous for its association with Jango Fett, a bounty hunter in Mandalorian armor. Fett packed the craft with weapons, from laser cannons and projectile launchers to seismic charges. After Jango's death, Boba Fett refitted the ship and made it his own. A generation after his father's death, the distinctive craft remained the last thing fugitives wanted to see on their scanners.",
