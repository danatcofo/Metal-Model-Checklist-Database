    "description": "The beach buggy is a special type of vehicle specifically designed for use on beaches. They normally feature rear-mounted engines that transfers a high proportion of the weight to the rear-drive wheels for extra traction plus small wheels and thin tires, to help facilitate movement across the sand.",
