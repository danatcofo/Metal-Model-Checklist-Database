    "description": "The Scorpion’s rugged, adaptable design has changed little from its origins at the dawn of human interstellar colonization. This vehicles has remained in service due a combination of affordability, simplicity, and versatility that is difficult to match by other – supposedly superior – designs. The Scorpion’s functional uses are numerous and varied, though the UNSC uses it predominantly for direct assault, localized defense, and anti-armor operations. The new M820 model of the storied Scorpion is half the mass of the old M808, yet has nearly identical firepower and armor protection.",
