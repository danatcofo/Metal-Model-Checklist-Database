    "description": "BB-8™, is a BB unit astromech droid who operated approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor™. It had a dome head, similar to that of R2 series astromech droids, with the bulk of its body made up of a ball on which the droid's head rolled. BB-8™ was mostly white, with some silver and orange on its body, as well as a black photoreceptor. The droid belonged to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron™, whom he accompanied during his flights on his T-70 X-Wing Fighter.",
