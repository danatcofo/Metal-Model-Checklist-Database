    "description": "The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center of New York opened in 1986. Named after Senator Jacob K. Javits (US Senator District 1957-1981), the glass-enclosed building was designed by I.M. Pei & Partners. Javits is the busiest convention center in the United States attracting top tradeshows and hosting more than 2.5 million visitors annually. In 2013 the Center completed a major renovation that includes a new roof, replacement of the exterior glass wall, upgrades to the mechanical and electrical systems and interior reconfigurations. Designed by Javits II Architecture, LLC, the renovation has enhanced the visitor experience and the building’s operational efficiency while remaining true to the original design concepts.",
