    "description": "The name comes from the Greek word meaning prophet because they appear to be praying when their forelegs are clasped together. They are carnivorous and are equipped with sharp spines along their front legs to grasp prey. The mantis is a very unique insect in that it can turn its head 180 degrees, has only one ear and some are large enough to capture humming birds.",
