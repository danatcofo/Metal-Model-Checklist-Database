    "description": "Was flown in World War I by the famous Manfred Von Richthofen. The plane's tri-wing design allowed for superior maneuverability which was critical to WWI dogfighting. Due to the triplane's crimson color, Richthofen was dubbed the 'Red Devil' by the WWI French (this nickname was changed to 'Red Baron' after the war).",
