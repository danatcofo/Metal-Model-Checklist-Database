    "description": "A symbol of Americana, Ford trucks have outsold every other vehicle in US history with the F-150 model reigning as king. The 1982 Ford F-150 was the first model to feature the now iconic blue Ford oval emblem on the grille. This model year also introduced a stronger frame, which would underpin this series for about 15 years.",
