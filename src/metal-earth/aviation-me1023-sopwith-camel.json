    "description": "The Sopwith Camel is a British World War I single-seat biplane fighter aircraft introduced on the Western Front in 1917. Unmatched in its maneuverability, it achieved more aerial victories than any other allied aircraft during the war. Also, the legendary WWI ace, Snoopy, flew this plane in his many dog fights against The Red Baron.",
