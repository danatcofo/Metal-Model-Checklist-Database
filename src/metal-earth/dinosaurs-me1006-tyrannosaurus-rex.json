    "description": "The Tyrannosaurus rex lived throughout what is now western North America around 68 to 66 million years ago. It was by far the largest carnivore in its environment measuring 40 feet in length and 13 feet tall with a weight of more than 7 tons. It was among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before a sudden mass extinction wiped out three-quarters of the plant and animal species on Earth.",
