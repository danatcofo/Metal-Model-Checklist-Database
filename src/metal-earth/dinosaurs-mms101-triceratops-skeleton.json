    "description": "The name from Greek means 3 horned face. This dinosaur was about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall and weighed 4 to 6 tons. Stout limbs supported its girth but it was unlikely the dinosaur could move very quickly. Like a modern-day rhinoceros, it probably spent much of its time grazing on plant matter.",
