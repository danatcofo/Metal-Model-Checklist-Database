    "description": "The Sultana was a commercial side-wheel, Mississippi steamboat that sank in 1865 killing 1,169 passengers and crew. Many of those who died were union soldiers who had just been released from a confederate prison camp. This tragedy remains the worst maritime disaster in United States history.",
