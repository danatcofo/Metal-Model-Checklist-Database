    "description": "The MiG-15 is a single-seat, single-engine Soviet jet fighter, built by the Russian aerospace and defense company, Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG). It was used extensively in combat during the Korean War (1950–53). When first introduced into the Korean war, the United States was shocked by the plane’s speed, climbing ability, and high operating ceiling. In response, the United States hurried to deliver the new F-86 Sabre jet in order to reestablish U.S. air supremacy in the war.",
