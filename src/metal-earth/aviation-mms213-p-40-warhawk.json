    "description": "Is an American single-engine ground attack aircraft made famous in combat during World War II by the First American Volunteer Group (AVG) of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942, nicknamed the Flying Tigers.\r\nWhile the P-40 could not match the maneuverability of the opposing Japanese fighters, it was faster in a dive, sturdy and had an excellent roll rate.",
