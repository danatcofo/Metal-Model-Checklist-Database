    "description": "The African Elephant is the largest land animal on Earth, recognized by its enormous ears that resemble the shape of the African continent and its two prominent tusks used for digging, foraging, and defense. African elephants play a critical ecological role by facilitating ecosystem biodiversity, yet they face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching for their ivory tusks.",
