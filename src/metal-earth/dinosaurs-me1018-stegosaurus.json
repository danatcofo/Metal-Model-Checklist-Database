    "description": "The stegosaurus was an armored dinosaur that lived about 150 million years ago. It had a heavily rounded back, short forelimbs, its head held low to the ground, and a stiffened tail held high in the air. The double plates along its back were most likely used for defense and may also have regulated its temperature. Stegosaurus weighed about 6,800 pounds and stood 9 feet tall.",
