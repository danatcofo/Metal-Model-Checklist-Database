    "description": "Perhaps no vehicle represents Americana more than the classic ’57 Chevy. This iconic automobile is at the heart of many American stories and has been memorialized in song, motion pictures and television. Chevrolet designed the 1957 Bel Air as a luxury trim, featuring an optional Ramjet fuel injection V8, prominent vertical tail fins and a chrome front bumper with stylish torpedo accents under the headlamps. The new bold look and unique features such as signal seeking radio that was usually reserved for highly expensive luxury cars, made this model’s popularity soar.",
