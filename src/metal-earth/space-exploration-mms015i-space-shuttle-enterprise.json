    "description": "The First Space Shuttle built was the Enterprise. It was built by Rockwell International to be used by NASA for test flights in the atmosphere. The Enterprise had been designed so it could be refitted and used for orbital flight. However, this plan proved too expensive and so it was decided to simply build a new shuttle called Challenger. The Enterprise now resides in the Intrepid Museum in New York City.",
