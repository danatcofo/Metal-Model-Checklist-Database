    "description": "The Chevy Chevelle was produced from 1964 through 1977.  The creation of the Chevelle Super Sport (SS) in 1966 was an aggressive move by GM to compete against the new powerful Chrysler muscle cars. The 1970 Chevelle SS with its 450 hp engine was ready for drag racing as soon as it rolled off the assembly line.",
