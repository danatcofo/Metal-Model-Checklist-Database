    "description": "The Batmobile™ is the Batman's primary mode of transportation. The vehicle is one of the most daunting components in his vast arsenal, keeping it stored in the Batcave™ when not in use. Affectionately dubbed the \"Keaton-mobile\" after Michael Keaton; the actor playing Batman™/Bruce Wayne™ in the films at the time, the car's popularity with fans has established a strong following and easily ranks with the 1966 Batmobile™ as one of the most popular Batmobiles of all time.",
