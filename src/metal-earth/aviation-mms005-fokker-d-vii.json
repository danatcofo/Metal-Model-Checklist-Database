    "description": "Manfred von Richthofen praised this aircraft as the best he had flown. It offered excellent performance, yet it was safe and easy to fly. Richthofen's recommendation led to the first provisional order for 400 production aircraft. In all, Germany produced around 3,300 D-VII aircraft in summer and autumn of 1918.",
