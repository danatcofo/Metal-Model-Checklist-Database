    "description": "The Sago Palm Tree (Cycas revolute) is often called a “living fossil” because it is one of the most primitive seed plants alive today. Its origin traces back to ancient flora of the Mesozoic era more than 200 million years ago. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive whorled feathery leaves.",
