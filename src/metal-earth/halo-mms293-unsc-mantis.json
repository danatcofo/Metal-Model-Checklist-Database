    "description": "The Mantis is an all-environment bipedal walker used by the UNSC military. An evolution of earlier research and development involving military exoskeletons, the Mantis also integrates many technologies – such as shield generators and neural interface controls - created for the Spartans’ MJOLNIR power armor. The Mantis weapon package consists of a M655 20mm rotary autocannon and six-chamber M5920 rocket launcher.",
