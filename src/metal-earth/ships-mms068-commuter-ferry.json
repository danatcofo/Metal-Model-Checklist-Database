    "description": "Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands. The world’s busiest ferry route is the Staten Island Ferry which shuttles commuters between Manhattan and Staten Island in New York City. However, the Washington State Ferry system operates the largest ferry fleet in the United States with 22 ferries that cross Puget Sound and its inland waterways, carrying over 23 million passengers.",
