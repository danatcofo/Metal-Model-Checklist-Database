    "description": "The Red Spotted Purple is native North America with subspecies in Central America. The upper side is mostly blackish-blue with a row of red spots on the forewing. The hindwings are either a bright iridescent blue or an iridescent bluish-green.  Both the males and females look exactly the same but one difference is that the females are larger than the males.",
