    "description": "Clownfish are also known as Anemonefish due to the fact that they live a symbiotic relationship with sea anemones. The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, provides a food source, and a safe nest site. The activity of the clown fish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone and their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone which then catches them. They are endemic to the warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific Ocean but are not found in the Atlantic Ocean.",
