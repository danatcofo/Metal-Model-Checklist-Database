    "description": "When stationed on Hoth™, the Rebel Alliance™ modified T-47 Air Speeder™ to become snowspeeders, fast flying conveyances for patrol and defense of their hidden base. It took some doing to keep the crippling cold from permanently grounding their air force, but Rebel ingenuity overcame the relentless Hoth™ elements. The T-47 Air Speeder™ is a small, wedge-shaped craft with two forward-facing laser cannons. In its rear arc is a harpoon gun fitted with a heavy-duty tow cable. The Snowspeeder™ is a two-man vessel, with a pilot and rear-facing tail gunner.",
