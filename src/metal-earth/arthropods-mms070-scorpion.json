    "description": "This predatory arachnid has eight legs and is easily recognized by a pair of grasping claws and a narrow segmented tail that is often carried in a characteristic forward curve over its back, ending with a venomous stinger. Scorpions can grow as large as 20 cm. Their venom has a fearsome reputation but only about 25 out of almost 1500 species are known to have venom capable of killing a human.",
