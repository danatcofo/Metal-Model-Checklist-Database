    "description": "Served as a high-altitude escort fighter and a low-level fighter-bomber for the allied forces during World War II. It was the largest, heaviest, and most expensive fighter aircraft in history to be powered by a single piston engine. The plane was designed and built around its powerful 2000 horse power Pratt and Whitney radial engine. Due to its thick and massive appearance, it came to be known as ‘The Jug.’",
