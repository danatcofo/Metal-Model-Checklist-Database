    "description": "The Brandenburg Gate is the only remaining gate through which Berlin was once entered. It was commissioned by King William II of Prussia as a sign of peace. The design is based upon the gateway to the Acropolis in Athens. Atop the gate is the Quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses driven by Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory.",
