    "description": "Darth Vader's TIE Fighter™ is the prototype that was used as the basis for all the terrifyingly effective TIE Fighters and Interceptors that would be developed for future battles. The TIE Fighter™ has proved itself in battle, as it is capable of withstanding many direct hits. In addition the pilots' chances of survival were considerably enhanced by the incorporation of a hyper drive system, which enables the ship to escape from hopeless battle situations.",
