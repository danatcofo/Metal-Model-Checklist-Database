    "description": "The Speeder Bike™ is a repulsor lift vehicle used for rapid reconnaissance and patrols, capable of high-speed maneuvers through dense terrain. Its lightweight frame and twin blaster mounts make it ideal for swift strikes and hit-and-run tactics. Commonly deployed by Scout Troopers™, its open design leaves riders exposed but allows for unmatched agility in forest or urban environments.",
