    "description": "Kylo Ren's command shuttle was an Upsilon-class command shuttle utilized by Lord Kylo Ren™, who was a member of the Knights of Ren™ and the First Order™ around thirty years after the Battle of Endor™. The First Order’s top officers travel in Upsilon-class command shuttles that look like grim birds of prey. These ships’ massive wings are packed with defensive systems to protect their valuable passengers. The upper wings contain advanced sensor suites that scan for enemies, while the lower wings house efficient shield projectors and powerful jammers. Upon landing, the wings rise from flight mode and then retract, encasing the upper wings’ sensor arrays in thick armor.",
