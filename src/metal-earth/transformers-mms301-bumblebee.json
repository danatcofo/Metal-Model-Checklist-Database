    "description": "Bumblebee™ has spent decades perfecting his fighting skills. With or without weapons, he is one of the most skilled fighters the Autobots™ have. He is dedicated to using his skills to defeat the Decepticons™, no matter where they appear. He is the little brother of the heroic or protagonistic Autobot™ faction and a mascot, constantly striving to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots-especially his leader, Optimus Prime™.",
