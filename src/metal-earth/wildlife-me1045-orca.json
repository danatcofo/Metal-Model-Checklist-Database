    "description": "The Orca (Killer Whale) is a powerful apex predator and the largest member of the dolphin family, distinguished by its striking black-and-white coloration. These highly intelligent and social mammals form complex familial pods, each with unique vocal behaviors and hunting techniques, which are passed down through generations. Orcas inhabit all of the world's oceans.",
