    "description": "This German tank was the most powerful tank in the world when it was introduced in August 1942. The 88mm gun was extremely powerful and the heavy armor made it almost impervious to attack. The success of the Tiger was so profound, that no allied tank dared to engage it in open combat. This psychological fear soon became to be known as \"Tigerphobia\".",
