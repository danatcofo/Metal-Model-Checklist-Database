    "description": "The Western Black Widow is a venomous spider found in western regions of North America. The female is recognized by an hourglass-shaped red mark on her lower abdomen. She poses a greater threat than the male, but her aggression surfaces only when she feels threatened or protecting her eggs. Although bites should be treated with medical care, recent studies have not confirmed fatalities caused by any U.S. species of black widow.",
