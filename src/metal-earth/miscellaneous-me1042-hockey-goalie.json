    "description": "In ice hockey, a goalie is the player responsible for preventing an opposing team from scoring, by stopping a hockey puck from entering their team’s net. Due to their unique position, a goalie uses different skates and a larger stick than the other players on the ice. The goalie will also wear more protective gear, as they may face direct impacts of a puck travelling over 100 MPH.",
