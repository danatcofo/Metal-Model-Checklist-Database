    "description": "The 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge was designed from the start to be brash and bold. It featured a powerful V8 engine, unique stripes, a blacked-out grille with optional hide-away headlamps, a rear spoiler, and the requisite 'The Judge' decals that set it apart from other muscle cars on the road.",
