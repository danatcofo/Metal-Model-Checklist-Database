    "description": "The first modern Ferris Wheel was designed and constructed by George Washington Ferris as a landmark for the 1893 Worlds Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The term Ferris wheel later came to be used generically for all such structures. As of 2012, the Singapore Flyer at 541 feet high is the world’s tallest wheel.",
