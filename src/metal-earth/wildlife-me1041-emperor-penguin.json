    "description": "Emperor Penguins are the tallest and heaviest penguins, standing up to 4 feet tall and weighing as much as 100 pounds. These flightless bird’s wings are used for swimming underwater up to 22 minutes reaching speeds of 25 miles per hour and can dive on average to depths of 500 meters. Emperor Penguins live exclusively in Antarctica and are sadly approaching endangered species status.",
