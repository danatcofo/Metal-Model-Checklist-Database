    "description": "The Bat-Signal™ is a distress signal device appearing in the various interpretations of the Batman™ mythos. It is a specially modified searchlight with a stylized symbol of a bat attached to the light so that it projects a large Bat emblem on the sky or buildings of Gotham City™. In the stories, the signal is used by the Gotham City™ Police Department as a method of contacting and summoning Batman™ to their assistance in the event of a serious crisis and as a weapon of psychological intimidation to the numerous villains of Gotham City™.",
