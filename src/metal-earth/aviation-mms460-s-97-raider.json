    "description": "The fastest next-generation helicopter in the world, the Sikorsky® S-97 Raider® features twin four-blade contra-rotating main rotors and a rear pusher propeller, allowing for a top speed of 276 MPH. What makes the Raider even more unique is its ability to turn its rear propeller on and off for ''Whisper Mode'', allowing it to sneak up on targets.",
