    "description": "The Tiger Swallowtail is native to eastern North America as well as Turkey.  The male is yellow with four black “tiger stripes” on each forewing.  Females may be either yellow or black, making them dimorphic.  The yellow morph is similar to the male, but with a conspicuous band of blue spots along the hindwing, while the dark morph is almost completely black.  This model is based off of the female yellow morph.",
