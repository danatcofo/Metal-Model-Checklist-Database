    "description": "The PBY Catalina was one of the most widely flown amphibious aircraft during WWII. During the war, it was used in anti-submarine warfare and as a long-range patrol bomber, a convoy escort, and a cargo transport.  Our model is based on the airworthy Catalina, Miss Pick Up, which is located in the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, UK. It represents a U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft lost to enemy action in Europe at the end of March 1945.To learn more about her, go to catalina.org.uk",
